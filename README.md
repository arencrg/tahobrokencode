#TAHO PO BY EL MUSAL

El Musal is the result my week-long fever dream of owning a breakfast-first (and -only) food service, and Taho Po! is the first product from the lineup.


This app/website is the final project of Term2 in the Vivixx Coding Bootcamp. It is to be pitched in front of Investors on Aug 17 2017. The whole project will take about a week for planning, coding, and designing.

Conceptualization started on Aug 11 2017, however the actual code started on Aug 15 2017 as I had planning issues with my absentee partner. (He has since made it up to me, kinda.

## TO DO

- Functionality still a bit lacking, please fix

- Presentation is in Rodolf's to-do, however I'm still a little iffy about letting him work on it. Will update eventually.
