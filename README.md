#TAHO PO BY EL MUSAL

El Musal is the result my week-long fever dream of owning a breakfast-first (and -only) food service, and Taho Po! is the first product from the lineup.

This app/website is the final project of Term 2 in the Vivixx Coding Bootcamp. It is to be pitched in front of investors on Aug 17 2017. The whole project will take about a week for planning, coding, and designing.

Conceptualization started on Aug 11 2017, however the actual code started on Aug 15 2017 as I had planning issues with my absentee partner. (As of Aug 16, I have decided to just kick him out of the project.)
